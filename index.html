              <div>
                  Growing up in South Louisiana i was afforded the oppurtunity to see a 
                  lot of the wild life as well as the city of New Orleans. Going fishing 
                  during the day and ending up in New Orleans for dinner and a night out 
                  was very common and a way of life down south.

                <div>
                    Going to the French Quarter as a kid and experiencing the culture, life, art and food 
                    really opened my mind. I was thrown into a very loving and accepting culture
                    that the south offers and in turn incoporated that mentality into my lifestyle. Even
                    after joining the Marine Corps my  southern roots and traditions remained and i was able
                    use that to build some of the best friendships anyone could ask for.

                    Leaving New Orleans after joining the Marine Corps in January 2013 was bitter sweet. Everything
                    and everyone i knew was left behind and i had to restart. I finished boot camp and trade school
                    and was sent to my first unit, V2/7. In September of 2014 i was then deployed to Iraq 19 months
                    after joining. It was a whirlwind of emotions but it was a great experience that i endured with
                    some amazing people. The days were long, nights were short and times were very memorable. If i
                    had to go back and do it all over again I'd probably do it twice.

                    After doing two tours overseas it was time to move onto the next chapter. I re-enlisted in 2017
                    and received orders to Marine Corps Installations Command at the Pentagon. If you would've told
                    me 5 years ago the Marine Corps would take me to the Pentagon I would've laughed, yet here i am.
                    Coming here allowed me to really hone in on the skills i wasn't utilizing while being with the
                    infantry. I've been afforded many oppurtunities to work alongside very knowledgable
                    Cyber Security personnel as well as Network Administrators.

                    Well this has been my journey with more to add later on down the road. I hope
                    to look back on this project to show where i started and to stay humble. There
                    will always be someone smarter but it's up to you to learn from that person
                    and make yourself better.
